1: Getting the source

Download the source from http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/radmind and
uncompress it into a directory of your liking.  The current development
source is also available through an anonymous CVS server.  See the radmind
web site for more details.

2: Configure the software

Using configure in the top level directory, configure the software for
your system:

  % ./configure

The configure scripts take several options:
  --with-server=SERVER specifies the default radmind serve
  --with-ssl=DIR specifies the non-standard ssl path
  --with-snet=DIR specifies the non-standard snet path

3: Build and install the software

Now you are ready to build the software

  % make

Once that is done, you can install the tools.

  % make install
