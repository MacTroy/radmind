.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lcreate
reads a transcript and uploads all corresponding files to the radmind server.
If the -n option is given, no files or transcripts are uploaded.  Instead,
.B lcreate
uses access(2) to verify all files in the transcript exist in the filesystem and are readable by the user.  If the -N option is
given, indicating the transcript specified for upload is
.B negative,
.B lcreate
will upload all corresponding files as zero length.  If the -T option is
given,
.B lcreate
will upload the transcript only. No corresponding files will be
uploaded. The transcript's stored name is, by default, the last part (
after the slash ) of the given path, or as specified by the name given
with the -t option.
.B lcreate
will print ( to the standard output ) the entire protocol exchange with the
radmind server when the -v option is given.
.sp
.B lcreate
stores a Macintosh HFS+ file's data and corresponding metadata in a single
.B applefile(5)
on the server. Systems running Mac OS X on UFS-formatted drives do not need
this special support.
