ktcheck must check that command file isn't a dir so when rename is called we
don't blow away a directory.

* try to recreate on eyeswide shut with ktcheck -K /tmp

Do we need to check that <serverpath>/<filepath> is longer then MAXPATHLEN

* not a big deal

Should we use "snet.h" or <snet.h>

* make all <snet.h>
* anything that is in a -L dir should be with <include.h> not "include.h"
which is for local dir.

Have Makefile update man pages with correct DEFAULTHOST info.

* use sed
man pages have marker, and install script runs sed to replace defines in
make file

Should ktcheck -v or lcksum -v print success/fail message after running?

* add one more line to be chatty

* Set Makefile to take on path to command file, then -K code just resets
this sting.  Then, add code to parse the string every time.  Make this code
shared.

* twhich read command.K for file, and list highest prec. transcript it's found
in.  With -a option, list all transcripts it's found in.  Also takes -K.
