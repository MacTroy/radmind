ktcheck must check that command file isn't a dir so when rename is called we
don't blow away a directory.

Do we need to check that <serverpath>/<filepath> is longer then MAXPATHLEN

Should we use "snet.h" or <snet.h>

per sweda: lcksum should rewrite file location to remove file system info using
the radmind server when run the -N option.

Have Makefile update man pages with correct DEFAULTHOST info.

Should ktcheck -v or lcksum -v print success/fail message after running?
