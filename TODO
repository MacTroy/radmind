* not a big deal

* anything that is in a -L dir should be with <include.h> not "include.h"
which is for local dir.

Have Makefile update man pages with correct DEFAULTHOST info.

* use sed
man pages have marker, and install script runs sed to replace defines in
make file

* Set Makefile to take on path to command file, then -K code just resets
this sting.  Then, add code to parse the string every time.  Make this code
shared.
