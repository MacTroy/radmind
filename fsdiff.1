.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fsdiff
reads a command file (the default name is
.B command.K)
to get a list of transcripts. If no command file is given, the
transcript list is considered to be the null transcript. The first
transcript listed in the command file has the lowest precedence, the
next higher, and the last has the highest.  If any special files are
listed, the
.B special.T
transcript will have the absolute highest precedence.
.B fsdiff
walks the filesystem starting at
.I path
and compares the filesystem to the transcripts.
.sp
If a transcript is
.B positive,
.B fsdiff
checks all attributes of each file system object
( i.e. file, directory, link, etc ).
If the -c option is given, checksums are also compared.
If a transcript is
.B negative,
.B fsdiff
checks only some of the attributes of the file system objects ( see
TRANSCRIPTS section below ). 
There is only one
.B special
transcript,
.B special.T,
and it contains references to files that are host specific, eg.
/etc/hostname.hme0.
.sp
Any discrepancies are printed on the standard output or, with the -o option,
to a file. The default is to print the differences as edits to the
transcript to make it match the filesystem. If the edit direction
chosen is -T, the differences are printed as edits to the file system
to make it match the transcript. A "+" at the beginning of a line
indicates a file must be downloaded. A "-" indicates the given object (
file, directory, link etc ) must be removed.
.sp
.SH TRANSCRIPTS 
A transcript contains a list of filesystem objects, eg. directories,
files, symbolic links etc. Transcripts have the following format:
.sp
.br
type	path	[type specific information]
.br
.sp
Type is a single letter: h, l, d, c, b, p, s, D, f. Path is the encoded
path, where space is "\\b", tab is "\\t", newline is "\\n" and
\\ is "\\\\". The type specific information varies.
.sp
.br
l	path	target
.br
h	path 	target
.br
.sp
Type 'l' is a symbolic link and 'h' is a hard link.  Target is encoded like
path.
.sp
.br
d	path	mode	uid	gid
.br
D	path	mode	uid	gid
.br
s	path	mode	uid	gid
.br
p	path	mode	uid	gid
.br
.sp
Type 'd' is a directory, 'D' is a door, 's' is a socket and 'p' is a named
pipe. Mode is a 4 digit octal representation of the permissions. 
( see
.BR chmod(1).
) uid and gid are the user and group ids in decimal format. If a
directory is listed in a 
.B negative
transcript, mode, uid and gid will be checked, but the directory itself
will not be read.
.sp
.br
b       path    mode    uid     gid     major   minor
.br
c       path    mode    uid     gid     major   minor
.br
.sp
Type 'b' is a block special file, 'c' is a character special file. Major
and minor are the major and minor device numbers in decimal. If a
character special file is listed in a 
.B negative 
transcript, only major
and minor device number will be checked.
.sp
.br
f       path    mode    uid     gid     mtime   size    checksum
.br
.sp
Type 'f' is a file. Mtime is a decimal number of seconds since 1970 GMT.
Size is the size of the file in bytes. Checksum is the base64 encoded
checksum if enabled, otherwise it is "-". If a file is listed in a 
.B negative
transcript, only mode, uid and gid will be checked.
.sp
Transcripts are sorted in depth first order, which means subdirectories have
precedence over files in the same directory. This means that "/" has
special precedence. So the file:
.sp
/etc/passwd  comes before /etc.old
.sp
even though "." comes lexically before "/"
.SH COMMAND FILES
Command files have the following format:
.br
.sp
type	transcriptname/pathname
.sp
.br
Type is any part of the words "positive", "negative" and "special". The
second argument is either a transcript name, or in the case of type
special, a full pathname.
.br
.br
.sp
# example command file
.br
p	solaris8base.T
.br
n	solarisneg.T
.br
s	/etc/printcap
.br
s	/etc/hostname.hme0
.br
.br
.sp
Lines beginning with "#" are comments, and are skipped. A comment must
be on a line by itself. Blank lines are also skipped.
.sp
If there is no command file, the transcript used is the null transcript.
This means
.B fsdiff
will print out a difference line for every object in the
filesystem, eg. a filesystem snapshot. 
.sp
.SH EXAMPLES
In this example, fsdiff is used to generate a line for the negative
transcript for /tmp.
.sp
.RS
.nf	
example% fsdiff -1 /tmp
d /tmp               1777     0     3
example%
.fi
.RE
.sp
A more complete negative transcript might look like this:
.sp
.RS
.nf
example% vi negative.T
f /etc/passwd        0444     0     3 993477914     482 -
d /proc              0555     0     0
d /tmp               1777     0     3
f /var/adm/lastlog   0444     0     1 993662219  976304 -
