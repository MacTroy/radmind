.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ktcheck 
verifies the command file with the radmind server 
.I host.  
The command file is downloaded from 
.I host 
if it is missing or has the wrong size.  With the -c option, checksums are
also used to verify files. 

Reading the command file line-by-line, ignoring blank lines and comments
( lines starting with # ), 
.B ktcheck 
verifies each positive and negative transcript listed, downloading it from 
.I host 
if it is missing or has a different checksum.

Each special file listed in the command file is converted into a
transcript line in special.T with information provided by 
.I host.
If checksuming is turned on, the special transcript is verified using
the checksum and file size.  If either are wrong, the special transcript
is updated.
If checksuming is 
turned off, the special transcript is always updated.

Files updated by
.B ktcheck
must be regular files and the user must have access to modify them.

When run with the \-n option,
.B ktcheck
verifies but never downloads the command file or transcripts.  A tempory 
special.T is created for verification and is removed on exit.
