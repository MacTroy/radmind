.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lapply
edits the file system to make it match the difference-transcript.  The
difference-transcript must be created with fsdiff using the -T option.
Lapply downloads missing files, indicated by a "+" in the
difference-transcript, removes file system objects marked with a "-" and
updates objects without a "+" or "-".  Given the -n option, lapply will
only remove and update files as described by the difference-transcript.
.sp
Downloaded files that are hard linked will be copied over to retain existing
hard links to that file.  
If the -s option is given, these files will be unlinked,
breaking any preexisting hard links.  When the -s option is used, fsdiff
and lapply should be run a second time to correct these broken links.
