.SH DESCRIPTION
lapply reads an appliable transcript line-by-line, modifying the file
system to match the transcript. Transcript lines are applied in order
unless they are directories marked for deletion.  In such cases,
subsequent transcript lines are first applied until the file system object 
listed is outside of the directory.  If another directory marked for
deletion is encountered, the process is started recursively.

lapply downloads missing files indicated by a "+" from the radmind server
.I host.
.I file
is applied to the system with the attributes as described in
the transcript line.  File system objects marked with a "-" are removed.
Other transcript lines indicate that a file system
object must be modified or created if missing.  lapply is not able to create doors or sockets.

File system objects listed in the transcript and present in the
file system as a different type are automatically removed.

If
.I appliable-transcript
is not given,
.B lapply
will use the standard input for reading.

.sp
.B lapply
is also capable of decoding
.B applefiles
stored on the server by
.B lcreate(1),
restoring the files' Mac OS HFS+ metadata to the client machine. (Mac OS X,
HFS+-formatted drives only.)
