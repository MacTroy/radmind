.SH NAME
.B lcksum 
\- verifies a transcript's checksums and file sizes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lcksum 
.RB [ \-%inqV ]
[
.BI \-P\  prefix 
]
.BI \-c\ checksum
.I transcript 
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lcksum
verifies and updates the checksums and file sizes of the 
appliable transcript 
.I transcript 
line-by-line.
.B lcksum
compares the checksum and
file size listed in
.I transcript
to that  
of the file in the file system.  Files must be located in
file directory associated with
.IR transcript .
With the \-n option
.B lcksum
verifies but does not modify
.IR transcript .

If there is a difference in either the checksum or file size, the
transcript line is updated using the checksum, file size and
modification time of the actual file. 

Since
.B lcksum
modifies the file size and/or checksum of
.IR transcript ,
the user must have write access to
.IR transcript .

.B lcksum
also verifies that 
.I transcript
is sorted in depth first order.

With the \-P option,
.B lcksum
will only verify transcript lines with paths starting with
.IR prefix .
