.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lcreate
reads a transcript and uploads all corresponding files to the radmind server.
.sp
.B lcreate
verifies the size listed in the transcript with the actual size of the file 
and stops on any differences.
If the -F option is given,
.B lcreate
will store the file on the server and give a warning.
.sp
If the -n option is given, no files or transcripts are uploaded.  Instead,
.B lcreate
uses access(2) to verify that all files in the transcript exist in the filesystem and are readable by the user.
.sp
If the -N option is
given, indicating the transcript specified for upload is
.B negative,
.B lcreate
will upload all corresponding files as zero length.
.sp
If the -T option is
given,
.B lcreate
will upload the transcript only. No corresponding files will be
uploaded. The transcript's stored name is, by default, the last part (
after the slash ) of the given path, or as specified by the name given
with the -t option.
.B lcreate
will print ( to the standard output ) the entire protocol exchange with the
radmind server when the -v option is given.
.sp
.B lcreate
stores a Macintosh HFS+ file's data and corresponding metadata in a single
.B applefile(5)
on the server.  With the -N option, applefiles are stored with a zero length
resource fork, zero length data fork and a creator type of RDMD.
Systems running Mac OS X on UFS-formatted drives do not need
this special support.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 19
.BI \-c\  checksum
enables checksuming.
.TP 19

force output linebuffering.
.TP 19
.B \-l
Turn on user authentication.  Requires a TLS.
.TP 19
.B \-N
uploads a
.B negative
transcript then uploads all corresponding files as zero length.
.TP 19
.B \-n
Don't upload any files or transcripts. Uses access(2) to verify all
files in the transcript exist in the filesystem and are readable.
.TP 19
.BI \-p\  port
specifies a port, by default
.BR 6662 .
.TP 19
.B \-q
suppress all messages.
.TP 19
.B \-r
use random seed file $RANDFILE if that environment variable is set,
$HOME/.rnd otherwise.  See
.BR RAND_load_file (3o).
.TP 19
.B \-T
uploads the transcript only, and
.B not
the corresponding files.
.TP 19
.BI \-t\  stored-name
specifies the name under which the transcript will be stored when saved

.B \-V
displays the version of 
.BR lcreate ,
a list  of supported checksumming algorithms in descending
order of preference and then exits.
.TP 19
.B \-v
displays communication with the radmind server.
.sp
.TP 19
.BI \-w\  auth-level
TLS authorization level, by default _RADMIND_AUTHLEVEL.
0 = no TLS, 1 = server verification, 2 = server and client verification.
